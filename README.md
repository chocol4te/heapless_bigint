# heapless_bigint

Very minimal big integer implementation using `heapless` Vec's. This is more of a hack for my fork of `srp` than a serious attempt at a usable library, so while I'm keeping kinda similar to the `num-bigint` library in terms of implementation and API, I make no promises in terms of stability, performance or correctness.
